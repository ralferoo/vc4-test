This is just an initial test of the VC4 toolchain, based on what I found
here:

alpha.bin comes from https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3669512/temp/alpha.bin

The disassembly of the original mostly proceeds well, except that the 65535
constant is too big for the assembler to accept, although it's OK with -1.

The opcodes are very different from the original (see alpha.notes)

BUG: the disassembly looks similar to the original, but the opcodes are
slightly different (see alpha.txt). However, feeding them back into gas
produces a disassembly that's wrong. See diff.txt but the codegen differences
seem to be mostly in the v16ld and v16st instructions, e.g. f940 instead of f850:
